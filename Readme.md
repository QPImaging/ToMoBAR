#  Regularised FISTA-type iterative reconstruction algorithm for X-ray tomographic reconstruction with highly inaccurate measurements

**This software supports research published in the following journal papers [1,2,3] with applications in [4-6]. Software depends on several software packages and requires a GPU (Nvidia) card to operate. FISTA-tomo is implemented in both MATLAB and Python (work in progress).**

## Software highlights:
 * Tomographic projection data are simulated without the "inverse crime" using [TomoPhantom](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom). Noise and artifacts (zingers, rings) can be modelled and added to data.
 * Simulated data reconstructed iteratively using FISTA-type algorithm with multiple "plug-and-play" regularisers from [CCPi-RegularisationToolkit](https://github.com/vais-ral/CCPi-Regularisation-Toolkit) 
 * Presented FISTA algorithm offers novel modifications: convergence acceleration with ordered-subsets method, PWLS, Group-Huber[3] and Students't data fidelities [1,2] to deal with noise and image artifacts
 * Various projection (2D/3D) geometries are supported and real data provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method  

### General software prerequisites
 * [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) or
 * Python
 * C compilers (GCC/MinGW) and nvcc [CUDA SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) compilers
 
### Software dependencies: 
 * [ASTRA-toolbox](https://www.astra-toolbox.com/)  
 * [TomoPhantom](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom)
 * [CCPi-RegularisationToolkit](https://github.com/vais-ral/CCPi-Regularisation-Toolkit) 
 * See [INSTALLATION](https://github.com/dkazanc/FISTA-tomo/blob/master/INSTALLATION) for detailed information

### Installation in Python (conda-build):
```
	conda build Wrappers/Python/conda-recipe --numpy 1.12 --python 3.5 
	conda install fista-tomo --use-local --force

```
 
### Package contents:
 * A number of demos for 2D/3D parallel and cone-beam geometry with 2D and 3D regularisation. Demos show how the methods deal with noise and artifacts. Also real-data example added to emphasise methods properties. Main reconstruction function *FISTA_REC.m* is controlled by various parameters, see the [details](https://github.com/dkazanc/FISTA-tomo/blob/master/main_func/FISTA_REC.m).
